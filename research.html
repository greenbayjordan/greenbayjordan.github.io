      <br> <researchtitle> Honors Programs </researchtitle> <br>
      Through participant observation and interviewing, Packer analyzed the advantages conferred by students enrolled in three honors programs.
      This research collection in March 2018, when a preliminary thesis was presented. At this point, Packer was presented with the UCSD department
      of Sociology's "Outstanding Academic Paper" award and received "highest distinction" from
      her thesis instructor.
      Now, Packer is in the process of revising her thesis for submission to the Sociology of Education journal. Below is the abstract of her work:
      <br> <br> <abstracttitle> Abstract </abstracttitle> <br> For college students,
      the undergraduate honors program is an opportunity to produce independent research
      with the guidance of an advisor. In addition to research skills, participation in the honors
      program yields many advantages in the form of capital and identity. This paper articulates the ways in which
      the honors program is a form of educational sorting similar to “advanced” secondary school tracks: honors students
      are conferred advantages that support their post-graduation goals. Through roughly 40 hours of observation and 15 interviews,
      I studied these supple advantages honors students receive.

      <researchtitle> Early Career Scholars </researchtitle> <br>
      Packer works for Mary Blair-Loy at <a href="http://crg-stemm.ucsd.edu/"> The Center for Research on Gender in STEMM </a>, which studies early career scholars in STEMM fields.
    Her research project explores the implicit barriers women and URMs face in the application process for tenure track faculty positions in STEM fields. Packer specifically
    codes job talk video recordings to see how, when, and if presenters are interrupted by audience members during their talk.

    <br> <br> <researchtitle> Dissertation Committees </researchtitle> <br>
      With Kevin Lewis, Packer analyzes the composition of dissertation committees at a large, research university. This dataset allows for understanding
      of gender, faculty position, and other imbalances on dissertation committees and their corresponding consequences for students.
