      <researchtitle> Early Career Scholars  </researchtitle> [March 2017 - November 2019] <br>
      <i> with Mary Blair-Loy </i> <br> <br>

      At <a href="http://crg-stemm.ucsd.edu/"> The Center for Research on Gender in STEM</a>, Jordan studied early career scholars in
      science, technology, engineering, math, and medical (STEM) fields. Her research project explored the implicit barriers women face
      in the application process for tenure track faculty positions in STEM. She specifically coded tenure-track faculty job talk video recordings to see
      the types and tones of interruptions during the job talk. She also managed undergraduate coders, analyzed the data
      in SPSS and Stata, and produced scholarly texts for publication. This fellowship provided Jordan with ample quantitative methods
      skills and knowledge of academic writing processes for her future solo work.

    <br> <br> <researchtitle> Dissertation Committees </researchtitle> [September 2017 - December 2019] <br>
      <i> with Kevin Lewis </i> <br> <br>
      Collaborating with Kevin Lewis, Jordan analyzed the composition of dissertation committees at a large, research university. This dataset allowed for understanding
      of gender, faculty position, and other imbalances on dissertation committees and their corresponding consequences for students. This data is novel and
      aims to lead the way for future sociologists of education to analyze the social network of dissertation committees. A paper on this research was submitted
      to <i> Socius </i>.

      <br> <br> <researchtitle> Honors Programs </researchtitle> [June 2017 - March 2018] <br>

      Through participant observation and interviewing, Jordan analyzed the advantages conferred by students enrolled in three honors programs.
      This research collection in March 2018, when her senior thesis was presented. Click <a href="./images/presentation.pdf"> here</a> to view the presentation.
      Below is the abstract:
      <br> <br> <abstracttitle> Abstract </abstracttitle> <br> For undergraduates, enrolling in an honors program is an opportunity to produce guided,
      yet independent research for the first time. In addition to research skills, however, participation in the honors program yields many identity
      and resource advantages to its students. This paper articulates how the honors program is a higher education form of educational sorting similar
       to “advanced” secondary school tracks: students who have historically been advantaged continue to gain advantages that support their expected
        post-graduation achievements. When those who join the honors program are those with confidence and ability predicated by their prior track,
        the honors program reproduces inequality. Through roughly 40 hours of observation and 15 interviews, I studied the supple implicit advantages
        honors students receive because of their participation.
