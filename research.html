  <h10> HONORS THESIS </h10> <br>
  This past fall and winter, Jordan participated in the Sociology Honors Program. In this independent research seminar, Jordan focused on the differences and advantages given by honors programs themselves. This research concluded in March 2018 and will be submitted to Sociology of Education journal.
  <h4> Abstract </h4> Undergraduate honors programs are an important aspect of educational sorting. For college students, the honors program is an opportunity to produce independent research with the guidance of an advisor. In addition to research skills, participation in the honors program yields many advantages in the form of capital and identity. This paper articulates the ways in which the honors program is similar to a high-level, or “advanced” secondary school track: honors students are conferred advantages that other students are not. Through roughly 40 hours of observation and 15 interviews, I studied the advantages honors students receive. The honors program itself creates the distinction between students and thus, similar skilled students receive advantageous resources and perceive themselves favorably because of their participation in the elite program. Because of this dynamic, the honors program plays a role in the reproduction of inequality.

  <h10> EARLY CAREER SCHOLARS </h10> <br>
  Jordan is a research assistant for <a href="http://crg-stemm.ucsd.edu/"> The Center for Research on Gender in STEMM. </a> Their research project seeks to explore the implicit barriers that push women and URMs away from faculty positions in STEM fields. The project involves researches applicants who apply for tenure-track faculty positions, and more specifically, the interruptions they experience during their job talks. The job talk is a portion of time where candidates present their own research to the department they are applying to work in. By looking at these dependent variables, we can find what discrepancies exist between applicants during the job talk portion of applying for a faculty position.
