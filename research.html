<researchtitle> The duality of students and faculty: Illustrating the sociological utility of doctoral committee data </researchtitle> <br>
  <i> with <a href="https://www.kevinlewis-sociology.com"
    style="color: black; text-decoration: none;">Kevin Lewis</a> </i> <br> <br>
  Collaborating with <a href="https://www.kevinlewis-sociology.com"
    style="color: black;">Kevin Lewis</a>, Jordan analyzed the composition of dissertation committees at a large, research university.
  This dataset allowed for understanding of gender, faculty position, and other imbalances on dissertation committees
  and their corresponding consequences for students. This data is novel and aims to lead the way for future sociologists
   of education to analyze the social network of dissertation committees. This paper was accepted to <i> Socius</i> in September 2020.

      At <a href="http://crg-stemm.ucsd.edu/"style="color: black; text-decoration: none;"> The Center for Research on Gender in STEM</a>, Jordan studied early career scholars in
      science, technology, engineering, math, and medical (STEM) fields. Her research team explored the implicit barriers women face
      in the application process for tenure track faculty positions in STEM. She specifically coded tenure-track faculty job talk video
      recordings to see the types and tones of interruptions during the job talk. She also managed undergraduate coders, analyzed the data
      in SPSS and Stata, and produced scholarly texts for publication. This research collaboration provided Jordan with ample
      quantitative methods skills and knowledge of academic writing processes for her future solo work.



      <br> <br> <researchtitle> The honors distinction </researchtitle>  <br>

      Through participant observation and interviewing, Jordan analyzed the advantages conferred by students enrolled
       in three honors programs. This research culminated in March 2018. Jordan received an Outstanding Paper Award for this project.
       See the presentation <a href="./images/presentation.pdf" style="color: black; text-decoration:none;"> <i><u>here</i></u></a>.
      Below is the abstract:
      <br> <br> <abstracttitle> Abstract </abstracttitle> <br> For undergraduates, enrolling in an honors program is an opportunity
       to produce guided independent research. In addition to research skills, participation in the
        honors program yields many identity and resource advantages. This paper articulates how the honors program
        is a form of educational sorting similar to “advanced” secondary school tracks: students who have historically
        been advantaged continue to gain advantages that support their expected achievements. When those who join the
        honors program are those with confidence and ability predicated by their prior track, the honors program reproduces inequality.
        Through roughly 40 hours of observation and 15 interviews, I studied the subtle advantages
        honors students receive.
