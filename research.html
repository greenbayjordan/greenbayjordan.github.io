      <br> <researchtitle> Honors Programs </researchtitle> <br>

      Through participant observation and interviewing, Packer analyzed the advantages conferred by students enrolled in three honors programs.
      This research collection in March 2018, when a preliminary thesis was presented. At this point, Packer was presented with the UCSD department
      of Sociology's "Outstanding Academic Paper" award and received "highest distinction."
    Below is the abstract:
      <br> <br> <abstracttitle> Abstract </abstracttitle> <br> For undergraduates, enrolling in an honors program is an opportunity to produce guided,
      yet independent research for the first time. In addition to research skills, however, participation in the honors program yields many identity
      and resource advantages to its students. This paper articulates how the honors program is a higher education form of educational sorting similar
       to “advanced” secondary school tracks: students who have historically been advantaged continue to gain advantages that support their expected
        post-graduation achievements. When those who join the honors program are those with confidence and ability predicated by their prior track,
        the honors program reproduces inequality. Through roughly 40 hours of observation and 15 interviews, I studied the supple implicit advantages
        honors students receive because of their participation.

      <researchtitle> Early Career Scholars </researchtitle> <br>
      <i> with Mary Blair-Loy </i> <br> <br>

      At <a href="http://crg-stemm.ucsd.edu/"> The Center for Research on Gender in STEMM </a>, Packer studies early career scholars in
      science, technology, engineering, math, and medical (STEM) fields. Her research project explores the implicit barriers women face
      in the application process for tenure track faculty positions in STEMM. Packer specifically codes tenure-track faculty job talk video recordings to see
      the types and tones of interruptions during the job talk. She also manages undergraduate coders, analyzes the data
      in SPSS and Stata, and produces scholarly texts for publication. This predoctoral program provides Packer with ample quantitative methods
      skills and knowledge of academic writing processes for her future solo work.

    <br> <br> <researchtitle> Dissertation Committees </researchtitle> <br>
      <i> with Kevin Lewis </i> <br> <br>
      Packer analyzes the composition of dissertation committees at a large, research university. This dataset allows for understanding
      of gender, faculty position, and other imbalances on dissertation committees and their corresponding consequences for students.
