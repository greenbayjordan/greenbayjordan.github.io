 <h2>About </h2>
</div>

<div class="about">
 Jordan Packer recently received her B.A. in Sociology - Social Inequality and Urban Studies and Planning at UC San Diego.
 She is now a staff research associate for the
 <a href="http://crg-stemm.ucsd.edu/"> Center for Research on Gender in STEMM </a> at UC San Diego,
where she analyzes applicants' experiences in pursuing tenure-track faculty positions. In her free time, Packer conducts her own research in the sociology of education, analyzing undergraduate honors programs and their impact in reproducing inequality.
She plans to pursue a PhD in sociology herself after her staff research associate fellowship. During her own PhD, Packer hopes to explore the cross-section of sociology of education, gender, and social networks with ethnographic work, focusing on patterns of human behavior that create stratification.
