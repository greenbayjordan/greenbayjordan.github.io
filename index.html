      <p>
        Jordan Packer received her B.A. in sociology - social inequality
        and urban studies and planning from UC San Diego in 2018. Now, she is a staff research associate for the
        <a href="http://crg-stemm.ucsd.edu/"> Center for Research on Gender in STEMM</a> under Mary Blair-Loy.
        In this position, Packer studies the subtle gender barriers to the hiring of new academic scientists.
        She is the primary coder of the video-recordings of candidatesâ€™ formal job talks to determine social interactions, such as interruptions.
        Packer also analyzes the data in SPSS. Packer plays a large role in the production of
        scholarly texts for publication with the Center for Research on Gender in STEMM team.

        <br> <br>
        Packer's research interests include gender, work, and education. Currently, Packer is researching
        undergraduate honors programs and their role in reproducing inequality.
        This research's preliminary thesis, "The Honors Distinction,"
        culminated spring of 2018, and proceeded to win the UCSD Sociology Department's
        Outstanding Academic Paper Award. In January 2019, "The Honors Distinction" was submitted to ASA's 2019 conference.

        <br> <br>
        Fall of 2019, Packer will apply for sociology PhD programs that emphasize mixed methods, gender, and education.
