 <h1>JORDAN “THE PACKER” PACKER</h1>
 <h2>About me.</h2>
 <p>Jordan Packer is a senior sociology major at UC San Diego, minoring in Urban Studies and Planning. Her primary interests are sociology, education, and non-fiction writing. She often likes to explore the cross-section of these disciplines with ethnographic work, writing about the patterns of human behavior. Within these fields, Jordan has a particular interest in social networks and gender.

Jordan is a research assistant for the Center for Research on Gender in STEMM, where she analyzes the tangible differences men and women face when pursuing tenure-track faculty positions. She herself is interested in pursuing a PhD in Sociology, with the hope of becoming a professor down the road.
